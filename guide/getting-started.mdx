To develop for MetaMask, install MetaMask in the browser of your choice on your development machine. [Download here](https://metamask.io/).

::: warning A quick note...
This guide assumes intermediate knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
:::

Once MetaMask is installed and running (make sure you back up your Secret Recovery Phrase), you should find that new browser tabs have a `window.ethereum` object available in the developer console.
This is how your website will interact with MetaMask.

You can review the full API for that object [here](./ethereum-provider.html).
Note that **over the course of 2020**, we introduced significant changes to this API, and we recommend that you refer to its documentation.

## Basic Considerations

### Web3 Browser Detection

To verify if the browser is running MetaMask, copy and paste the code snippet below in the developer console of your web browser:

```javascript
if (typeof window.ethereum !== 'undefined') {
  console.log('MetaMask is installed!');
}
```
